// Applying an SVG filter to an HTML element, with WebKit's coordinate origin
// pinned. Every renderer here goes through this — a filter that positions
// anything in `userSpaceOnUse` is silently wrong in Safari without it.
//
// THE BUG
//
// WebKit resolves userSpaceOnUse coordinates on a filter applied to an HTML
// element — BOTH the filter region and any primitive subregion — against the page
// origin instead of the element's own origin, unless the element establishes a
// coordinate system of its own. Measured on a 200x200 element at page (50,50),
// with a filter region at x=0 y=0 and an feImage subregion at x=60 y=60:
//
//                    subregion lands   region lands
//     webkit             60,60            0,0        <- element origin ignored
//     firefox           110,110          50,50
//     chromium          110,110          50,50
//
// So the map went wherever the element happened to sit in the document: further
// down the page, further off. That is the single cause behind the lens appearing
// to split into a stuck layer and a moving one, glass text and glass marks
// rendering as blank space (their chain ends in `operator="in"` against
// SourceAlpha, so a map that landed elsewhere clips the result to nothing), glass
// images cutting off, and controls losing their backdrop while pressed.
//
// THE FIX
//
// Any transform-family property on the element normalises the origin, in every
// engine:
//
//     none            webkit  60,60 / 0,0
//     transform       webkit 110,110 / 50,50   correct
//     translate       webkit 110,110 / 50,50   correct
//     scale           webkit 110,110 / 50,50   correct
//     rotate          webkit 110,110 / 50,50   correct
//     perspective     webkit  60,60 / 0,0      (not a transform — no help)
//
// A real non-identity transform works too, and all three engines then agree on
// the scaled result, so this composes with a page that transforms the element.
//
// We use the `rotate` longhand rather than `transform` so we never clobber a
// `transform` the page owns, and only when the element has no transform-family
// property at all — if it has one, its origin is already correct and we leave it
// alone. The identity costs nothing in side effects: an element with a `filter`
// is already a stacking context and already a containing block for positioned
// descendants, so an identity transform changes neither.

// WebKit, and not Chromium (which also ships AppleWebKit in its UA). Three separate
// workarounds below gate on this. Same shape as supportsBackdropUrl()'s engine test
// in mount.ts, and for the same reason: none of these have a feature test — observing
// them needs a rasterized readback of a DOM element — so the engine is the only signal.

 * measurably worsens the frame-time tail (firefox p90 8.9ms -> 58.8ms, chromium 9.2ms

 * Chromium and Gecko use CSS px — and it does this to the whole primitive
 * coordinate space, positions and lengths alike. On a 64-unit viewBox drawn at
 * 200px (3.125x), measured:
 *
 *   feImage subregion x=20 y=20 100x100   webkit 112,112 (clipped 138)  others 70,70 100x100

 *
 * So a glass mark got its map drawn 3x oversized and offset — the artwork lost its
 * rim and showed a dark misplaced crescent — and its displacement and blur were
 * scaled up to match. The filter REGION is unaffected: filterUnits resolves in CSS
 * px in every engine, including WebKit, on the same element.
 *
 * Multiplying primitive values by viewBoxWidth/cssWidth cancels it exactly. The
